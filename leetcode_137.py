'''
Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
